Our keyrings are handmade from authentic vintage coins. This one is from the reign of George VI and is dated 1961. The brass threepence was only minted from 1937 to 1967. In Â£1 there was 80 threepences, so quite a small coin in terms of value. But now they make a perfect gift for a 70th birthday. Note that the 1949, 1946, 1950 and 1951 are considered rare in the collection. 

Your coin will be presented in a small cotton padded gift box along with a mini card for you to write a short message (please see the dimensions below as this is not a large item!).
